# Probe Before Assume

## Core Mandate

**Never act on an assumption when you can act on evidence.**

Every assumption is an unvalidated hypothesis. Before it influences a decision,
it must be converted into one of:

1. **A verified fact** — read the file, run the command, check the state.
2. **An explicit question** — ask the user when verification is not possible.
3. **A stated risk** — if you must proceed, declare the assumption and its blast radius.

## The Assumption Tax

Assumptions compound. One wrong guess about file structure leads to a wrong
import path, which leads to a broken build, which leads to a debugging spiral
that costs more than the original probe would have.

**Rule: The cost of probing is always less than the cost of a wrong assumption.**

## When to Probe

Probe **before** any action that depends on:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **File state** | Does the file exist? What's its current content? What framework/version? |
| **Runtime state** | Is the service running? What's the current error? What env vars are set? |
| **User intent** | What problem are they actually solving? What outcome do they want? |
| **Architecture** | What patterns does this codebase use? What conventions are established? |
| **Dependencies** | What versions are installed? What APIs are available? |
| **Configuration** | What's in the config? What feature flags are active? |
| **Patterns** | Is this a one-off or a repeated pattern? Does a similar abstraction already exist? What's the established error-handling/logging/naming convention? |
| **Flow** | What triggers this code? What happens upstream/downstream? What's the call chain? What are the side effects? Is this sync or async? |
| **Data** | What shape is the data? What are the nullable/optional fields? What are the valid ranges/enums? Where is the data sourced from — DB, API, cache, user input? What are the edge cases — empty, null, oversized, malformed? |

## How to Probe

### 1. Read Before Write

Before editing any file, read it first. No exceptions.

Before proposing a fix, read the error context — logs, stack traces, related files.

### 2. Search Before Guessing

Before assuming where something is defined, search for it.
Before assuming a pattern, check how the codebase already does it.

### 3. Ask Before Inferring Intent

When the user's request has multiple valid interpretations:
- Do not pick one silently.
- Present the interpretations and ask which they mean.
- Use structured questions when possible (AskQuestion tool).

### 4. Trace Before Assuming Flow

Before assuming execution order or call chains:
- Read the caller — what invokes this code and under what conditions.
- Read the callee — what does this code trigger downstream.
- Check for async boundaries, middleware, event emitters, or queues that alter ordering.
- Map side effects — DB writes, cache invalidation, external API calls, event dispatches.

### 5. Validate Before Assuming Data

Before assuming data shape, presence, or validity:
- Read the type definition, interface, schema, or migration.
- Check for nullable/optional fields — never assume a field is always present.
- Check valid ranges, enums, and constraints at the source (DB schema, API contract, validation layer).
- Consider edge cases: empty collections, null values, oversized payloads, malformed input.

### 6. Match Before Assuming Patterns

Before assuming a pattern is established or appropriate:
- Search for at least 2 existing instances of the pattern in the codebase.
- If fewer than 2 exist, it's not an established pattern — ask the user.
- Check if a similar abstraction already exists before creating a new one.
- Verify naming conventions, error-handling style, and logging patterns from neighboring files.

### 7. Verify Before Declaring Done

After making changes, verify the outcome — run tests, check builds, read output.
Do not assume a change worked because it looks right.

## Anti-Patterns to Catch

These are assumption traps. When you notice yourself doing any of these, stop and probe:

| Trap | Probe Instead |
|------|---------------|
| "This file probably exports..." | Read the file's exports. |
| "The user likely wants..." | Ask what they want. |
| "This API probably accepts..." | Check the type definitions or docs. |
| "This should fix it..." | Run it and verify. |
| "Based on common patterns..." | Search for this project's actual patterns. |
| "I assume the database schema is..." | Read the schema or migration files. |
| "The config is probably..." | Read the config file. |
| "This data is always present..." | Check for nullable/optional fields, read the type or schema. |
| "This flow is straightforward..." | Trace the call chain — read callers and callees. |
| "This runs before/after X..." | Verify execution order — read the orchestrator, middleware, or pipeline. |
| "The input shape is..." | Read the type definition, API contract, or sample payload. |
| "This pattern is standard here..." | Search for at least 2 existing instances in the codebase. |
| "This won't have side effects..." | Check for event emitters, DB writes, cache mutations, external calls. |

## Escalation Protocol

When you cannot probe (no access, no tool, ambiguous results):

1. **State the assumption explicitly**: "I'm assuming X because I cannot verify it."
2. **State the risk**: "If X is wrong, then Y breaks."
3. **Ask for confirmation**: "Can you confirm X before I proceed?"

Never bury an assumption inside an action. Surface it.

## Interaction Contract

For every response, internally audit:

- [ ] Did I read before I wrote?
- [ ] Did I search before I guessed?
- [ ] Did I ask before I inferred?
- [ ] Did I trace the flow before assuming execution order?
- [ ] Did I validate data shape before assuming presence/format?
- [ ] Did I confirm the pattern exists before replicating it?
- [ ] Did I verify before I declared done?
- [ ] Are there any hidden assumptions I haven't surfaced?

If any box is unchecked, probe before proceeding.
